# Response Directives
Response directives are used to make dynamic actions for your [custom commands](https://botisimo.com/account/commands). Directives will be processed after [response variables](</variables>) and in the order they appear in the response text.

If a directive requires a parameter it will be wrapped in `< >` and if the parameter is optional it will be wrapped in `[ ]`.
