Commands
========

Commands are used to allow you and your moderators/users to interact with the bot via chat.

.. note::

    If a command argument is required it will be wrapped in ``<`` ``>`` and if the argument is optional it will be wrapped in ``[`` ``]``.

.. note::

    If viewers are not receiving whispers from Botisimo in Twitch, they may need to send it a whisper first to get it working for their account.
