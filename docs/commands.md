# Available Commands
Commands are used to allow you and your moderators/users to interact with the bot via chat

Below is a list of the default commands available with Botisimo. They are grouped according to the default permission settings but the settings may differ per account. If a command argument is required it will be wrapped in `< >` and if the argument is optional it will be wrapped in `[ ]`.

**NOTE:** If users are **NOT** receiving whispers from Botisimo in Twitch, they may need to send it a whisper first to get it working for their account.

  - `!login [platform=twitch]` - Receive a link to authorize chat mirroring for your Discord user (platform can be `twitch` or `mixer`)
